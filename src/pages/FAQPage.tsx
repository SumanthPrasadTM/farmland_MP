      question: 'What is managed farmland investment?',
      answer: 'Managed farmland investment is a form of real estate investment where you purchase agricultural land that is professionally managed by our team. You own the land, while we handle all aspects of farm operations, crop selection, maintenance, and sales. This allows you to earn returns from both land appreciation and crop production without the need for farming expertise or active involvement.',
      category: 'general'
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      question: 'How much do I need to invest to get started?',
      answer: 'Our farmland investment opportunities start from â‚¹10 lakhs for a small plot. We offer various plot sizes and payment plans to accommodate different investment budgets. Premium farms in prime locations may have higher starting prices. We recommend scheduling a consultation with our investment advisors to find the best option for your budget and goals.',
      category: 'investment'
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      question: 'Do I actually own the land?',
      answer: 'Yes, you receive full ownership of the land with a registered sale deed in your name. The land is your asset, and we provide management services through a separate agreement. Your ownership is legally documented and transferable to heirs or can be sold to other buyers in the future.',
      category: 'ownership'
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      question: 'What crops are grown on the farms?',
      answer: 'We primarily focus on high-value perennial crops such as mango, coconut, teak, and other fruit-bearing trees that provide sustainable long-term returns. The specific crop selection depends on the farm location, soil conditions, and market demand. Our agricultural experts determine the optimal crop mix for each farm to maximize returns while ensuring sustainable farming practices.',
      category: 'management'
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      question: 'What kind of returns can I expect?',
      answer: 'Investors typically see returns from two sources: land appreciation (5-8% annually) and crop production (8-12% annually once trees reach maturity). Combined returns generally range from 13-20% annually over a 10-year period. However, agricultural returns can vary based on market conditions, crop performance, and weather patterns. We provide detailed projections for each specific farm project.',
      category: 'returns'
    },
    {
      id: 6,
      question: 'How long is the investment period?',
      answer: 'Farmland investment is typically a medium to long-term investment. While you can sell your land at any time, we recommend a minimum holding period of 5-7 years to realize the full benefits of both land appreciation and crop production. Perennial crops like fruit trees take 3-5 years to reach full production capacity, after which returns tend to increase significantly.',
      category: 'investment'
    },
    {
      id: 7,
      question: 'What are the risks involved?',
      answer: 'Like any investment, farmland carries certain risks including weather events, crop diseases, market price fluctuations, and regulatory changes. We mitigate these risks through crop diversification, insurance coverage, professional management, and sustainable farming practices. Additionally, land as an asset has historically shown resilience during economic downturns compared to more volatile investments.',
      category: 'investment'
    },
    {
      id: 8,
      question: 'Who manages the day-to-day farm operations?',
      answer: 'Our professional farm management team handles all aspects of farm operations. This includes land preparation, planting, irrigation, fertilization, pest control, harvesting, and marketing of produce. The team consists of agricultural experts, horticulturists, and farm technicians with extensive experience in managing commercial farms. We provide regular updates and reports on farm activities to all investors.',
      category: 'management'
    },
    {
      id: 9,
      question: 'Can I visit my farm?',
      answer: 'Absolutely! We encourage investors to visit their farms. We organize regular farm visits and events where you can see your investment firsthand. Additionally, you can schedule private visits by contacting our customer service team. Many investors find these visits enjoyable and educational, especially for families with children who want to connect with nature and understand farming.',
      category: 'general'
    },
    {
      id: 10,
      question: 'What happens if I want to sell my land?',
      answer: 'You have complete freedom to sell your land at any time. We offer three options: 1) We can help market your land to our network of investors, 2) You can find a buyer independently, or 3) In some cases, we may offer a buyback option based on current market valuation. The sale process follows standard real estate procedures with transfer of title deed to the new owner.',
      category: 'ownership'
    },
    {
      id: 11,
      question: 'Are there any ongoing fees or maintenance costs?',
      answer: 'Yes, there is a farm management fee that covers all operational expenses including labor, inputs, irrigation, maintenance, and marketing of produce. This fee is typically structured as a percentage of gross revenue (around 20-30%) or as a fixed annual fee per acre. The specific fee structure is clearly outlined in the farm management agreement before investment.',
      category: 'management'
    },
    {
      id: 12,
      question: 'How are profits from crop sales distributed?',
      answer: 'After deducting the management fee and operational expenses, the profits from crop sales are distributed to landowners proportional to their land ownership. Distributions typically occur on a quarterly or semi-annual basis, depending on harvest cycles. Detailed financial statements are provided with each distribution, showing revenue, expenses, and net returns.',
      category: 'returns'
    },
    {
      id: 13,
      question: 'What documents will I receive as proof of ownership?',
      answer: 'You will receive a registered sale deed, land survey documents, land records extract (7/12 extract or equivalent), mutation entry in revenue records, and a comprehensive ownership certificate. All these documents legally establish your ownership of the specific land parcel. We assist with all documentation and registration processes to ensure proper legal transfer.',
      category: 'ownership'
    },
    {
      id: 14,
      question: 'Is farmland investment tax-efficient?',
      answer: 'Farmland investment offers several tax advantages in India. Agricultural income is generally exempt from income tax. Additionally, long-term capital gains from land appreciation benefit from indexation, reducing the effective tax rate. However, tax laws can change, and individual tax situations vary, so we recommend consulting with a tax advisor for personalized guidance.',
      category: 'investment'
    },
    {
      id: 15,
      question: 'What payment plans are available?',
      answer: 'We offer flexible payment options including lump-sum payment, 3-month installment plans, and extended payment plans up to 24 months for larger investments. Some premium projects may offer construction-linked payment plans. Each payment plan is structured to provide convenience while ensuring timely development of the farm project.',
